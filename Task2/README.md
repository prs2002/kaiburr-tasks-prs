# Task 2: Task 2. Swagger codegen

### Here we will document our api using swagger. Swagger is just an amazing tool to document our api. This is really helpful for the client side developer as he can easily see what methods to call in the client side. We will be generating html format documentation with the help of swagger.

###We will just add the following dependency to pom.xml and pom.xml will look like this.

```
 <dependency>
    <groupId>io.springfox</groupId>
    <artifactId>springfox-swagger2</artifactId>
    <version>2.9.2</version>
 </dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.springfox</groupId>
     <artifactId>springfox-swagger-ui</artifactId>
     <version>2.9.2</version>
</dependency>
```
